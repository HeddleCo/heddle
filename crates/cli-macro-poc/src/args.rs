//! Input shape (clap) — a FAITHFUL mirror of the real init args.
//!
//! This PoC mirrors the real `crates/cli/src/cli/cli_args/commands_args.rs:12`
//! `InitArgs`, which derives **`clap::Args`** (NOT `clap::Parser`) and is wired
//! as a tuple payload of the top-level subcommand enum
//! (`Commands::Init(InitArgs)`). clap's derive model reserves `Parser` for the
//! top-level parser and `Args` for reusable argument sets merged into a parent
//! — subcommand tuple-variant payloads must implement `Args`. An earlier draft
//! of this PoC derived `Parser` here, which measured the wrong clap shape: a
//! standalone parser the existing `Commands::Init(_)` variant cannot consume.
//!
//! The spike question for the input side is NOT "can a macro emit a clap
//! struct" (clap's own derive already does that) but "can ONE declaration emit
//! BOTH this clap args struct AND the output schema". `InitArgs` is the input
//! half of that single declaration; [`super::output::InitOutput`] is the output
//! half. The `Cli` / `Commands` wiring below proves the args struct slots into
//! a real subcommand tree — exactly the integration #205's `HeddleVerbArgs`
//! passthrough must preserve.
