# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `needs-triage` | `needs-triage` | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue |
| `needs-info` | `needs-info` | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent` | `ready-for-agent` | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent |
| `ready-for-human` | `ready-for-human` | Requires human implementation |
| `wontfix` | `wontfix` | Will not be actioned |

When a skill mentions a role, use the corresponding label string from this table.

## Additional Labels

`question` remains available as a general GitHub issue label for support, discussion, or clarification-style issues. Do not use `question` as a replacement for the `needs-info` triage state.

At setup time, GitHub already had `wontfix` and `question`. The other canonical labels may need to be created in GitHub before automated triage can apply them successfully.
